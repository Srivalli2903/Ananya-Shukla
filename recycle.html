                <p><b>E-Waste management</b> seeks to recover and process the electronic waste and recycle or refurbish it to make it useful. But, electronic recycling can be challenging especially because these devices are sophisticated and manufactured from varying proportions of glass, metals and plastics. Depending on the type of electronics, the process for recycling or refurbishing may change.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>e-Waste management process includes the following:</b>
                    <br>
                    <b>1. Collection:</b> gathering e-waste from various sources, enterprises, organizations and individuals.
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Dismantling:</b> Disintegration of all the components and materials of the e-waste to analyse which can be reused and which can go as scrap.
                    <br>
                    <b>3. Data Sanitization:</b> ensuring that data is rendered unusable or is completely wiped out to ensure it cannot be retrieved in any possible way.
                    <br>
                    <b>4. Recycling:</b> complete segregation of parts and materials that is then used to build new electronic products.
                    <br>
                    <b>5. Refurbishing:</b> reuse of the working, good quality products to replace parts and extend the life of other electronic equipment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Procedures to ensure that the e-waste is handled with care:</b>
                    <br>
                    1. e-Waste Collection and Transportation.
                    <br>
                    2. Sorting and Shredding if required.
                    <br>
                    3. Categorizing into core materials and components.
                    <br>
                    4. Dust Extraction and Magnetic separation.
                    <br>
                    5. Preparing the recycled materials for sale.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Dismantling ensures removal of critical components and we make sure to avoid the dilution of and contamination with toxic substances during the downstream process. Mechanical processing is an industry scale operation where concentrates of recyclable material is obtained and hazardous materials are separated. Gas emissions are filtered and effluents are treated to minimize environmental impact. Finally, we refine the resources and condition them to be reused.

                <p><b>Glass recycling</b> is the processing of waste glass into usable products. Glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted is called <b>cullet.</b> There are two types of cullet: internal and external. <b>Internal cullet</b> is composed of defective products detected and rejected by a quality control process during the industrial process of glass manufacturing, transition phases of product changes (such as thickness and colour changes) and production offcuts.<b> External cullet</b> is waste glass that has been collected or reprocessed with the purpose of recycling. External cullet (which can be pre- or post-consumer) is classified as waste. The word "cullet", when used in the context of end-of-waste, will always refer to external cullet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To be recycled, glass waste needs to be purified and cleaned of contamination. Then, depending on the end use and local processing capabilities, it might also have to be separated into different colors. Many recyclers collect different colors of glass separately since glass retains its color after recycling. The most common colours used for consumer containers are clear (flint) glass, green glass, and brown (amber) glass. Glass is ideal for recycling since none of the material is degraded by normal use.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many collection points have separate bins for clear (flint), green and brown (amber). Glass re-processors intending to make new glass containers require separation by color, because glass tends to retain its color after recycling. If the recycled glass is not going to be made into more glass, or if the glass re-processor uses newer optical sorting equipment, separation by color at the collection point may not be required. Heat-resistant glass, such as Pyrex or borosilicate glass, must not be part of the glass recycling stream, because even a small piece of such material will alter the viscosity of the fluid in the furnace at remelt.</p>

                <p>The <b>metal recycling</b> process is similar to the usual recycling process. The metals are first sorted on the basis or their properties. It is, however, important to have a basic understanding or knowledge about metals. This will help in recycling them and keeping a green environment. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The metal recycling process follows the following steps:</b>
                    <br>
                    <b>1. Collection:</b>  This is the first and most important step in metal recycling. It simply involves collecting all materials that are made of metals. This process should be organized in such a way that there should be containers specifically designed to collect metals.
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Sorting:</b>  Once the metals have been collected, the next important step is to sort the metals. This involves separating what can be recycled form what is non-recyclable. It is essential to point out that the quality of metal recycled is very important.
                    <br>
                    <b>3. Processing:</b>  After sorting, the next step is to compact or squeeze the metal. All the recycled materials are squeezed and squashed using machines so that they do not occupy so much space in the conveyor belts.
                    <br>
                    <b>4. Shredding:</b>  After the crushing and breaking of the metal, the shredding process starts. The metals are broken down into tiny pieces or sheets to allow further processing. The small pieces have a large surface to volume ratio that can be melted using less energy as compared to when they are in large pieces of metal. Normally, steel is changed into steel blocks while, on the other hand, aluminum is converted into sheets.
                    <br>
                    <b>5. Melting and Purification:</b>  Melting of the scrap metal takes place in a large furnace. Each metal is taken to a furnace that is specifically designed to melt that particular metal based on its specific properties. The melting process uses a considerable amount of energy. However, the energy required for melting recycled metal is less compared to the energy required to make metal from its raw material.
                    <br>
                    <b>6. Purification:</b>  After the melting process is complete, the next step is the purification process. Metals are purified using different methods. Purification of metals is done to ensure that the final product is free of impurities and that it is of high quality. Electrolysis is one of the methods of purifying metals.
                    <br>
                    <b>7. Melting and Solidifying of the Metal:</b>  After the purification process, the molten metal is then carried by the conveyor belt to a cooling chamber where it is cooled and solidified. It is at this stage that the scrap metal is made into a solid metal that can be used again. Other chemicals are then added into the molten metal to make it acquire its density and other properties.
                    <br>
                    <b>8. Transportation of the Metal Bars:</b>  Once the bars have been designed and made, the final product is then packed depending on their sizes and shapes ready for transportation to different factories and to people who require the metal. Thereafter, the cycle begins again.

                <p>The <b>recycling of paper</b> is the process by which waste paper is turned into new paper products. It has a number of important benefits: It saves waste paper from occupying homes of people and producing methane as it breaks down. Because paper fibre contains carbon (originally absorbed by the tree from which it was produced), recycling keeps the carbon locked up for longer and out of the atmosphere. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Around two-thirds of all paper products in the US are now recovered and recycled, although it does not all become new paper. After repeated processing the fibres become too short for the production of new paper - this is why virgin fibre (from sustainably farmed trees) is frequently added to the pulp recipe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are three categories of paper that can be used as feedstocks for making recycled paper: mill broke, pre-consumer waste, and post-consumer waste. Mill broke is paper trimmings and other paper scrap from the manufacture of paper, and is recycled in a paper mill. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Pre-consumer waste</b> is a material which left the paper mill but was discarded before it was ready for consumer use. <b>Post-consumer waste</b> is material discarded after consumer use, such as old corrugated containers (OCC), old magazines, and newspapers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Paper suitable for recycling is called "scrap paper", often used to produce moulded pulp packaging. The industrial process of removing printing ink from paper fibres of recycled paper to make deinked pulp is called <strong>deinking</strong>, an invention of the German jurist <strong>Justus Claproth</strong>.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Organic waste account for most of the waste created in nature which then directly affects urban living systems due to their high moisture content.
                    The excess moisture content increases the volume of waste while lowering their incinerator temperatures, causing an overall load of waste disposal.
                    In order to deal with these issues, various treatment methods and practices have been formulated and implemented throughout the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The utilization of microorganisms in organic waste management is also a viable means of improving soil fertility while disposing of such wastes.
                    During the process of organic waste recycling, the wastes are subjected to different forms of treatments, resulting in the conversion of waste into compost or vermicompost that can then be utilized as natural fertilizers.
                    Biological treatments are among the most convenient and effective alternative for treating organic waste.
                    These treatments help maximize recycling and recovery of waste components.
                    The primary objective of organic waste recycling is to maintain a sustainable cycle where the biodegradable fraction of organic waste is converted into useful organic manure or fertilizer through various recycling techniques.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Methods of organic waste recycling:</b> 
                <br> 
                <b>1. Animal feed:</b> One of the most common and efficient ways of recycling organic waste is by giving agricultural and food waste to cattle and other animals as food. Recycling of food through animal feed has many advantages like reduced pressure on landfills, reduced methane productions from fruits and vegetables, and the lack of need to convert organic waste into some other forms.  
                <br> 
                <b>2. Composting:</b> The process of decomposition of organic material where the organic material is acted on by soil organisms resulting in the recycling of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other soil nutrients into humus-rich components.
                <br> 
                <b>3. Anaerobic digestion:</b> It is a cost-effective technology for renewable energy production and treatment of high moisture and energy-rich material. During the anaerobic digestion process, anaerobic microorganisms convert different types of biomass and other organic wastes into biogas and nutrient-rich residue that can be used for lap applications.   
                <br> 
                <b>4. Rendering:</b> the process of conversion of waste animal tissues into stable and usable forms like feed protein. During the rendering process, fatty tissues, bones, and animal carcass are exposed to a high temperature of about 130°C and then pressurized to destroy pathogens.
                <br> 
                <b>5. Rapid thermophilic digestion:</b> The process of rapid fermentation of organic wastes by activating fermenting microorganisms at high temperatures. In a thermophilic digester, the feedstock is fed into the digester with air forced through the material to support the growth of aerobic microbes.It works six to ten times faster than a normal biodigester.
                <br> 
                <b>6. Immobilized enzyme reaction:</b> The use of enzymes over chemical catalysts in the treatment of wastewater and other similar waste products reduces the formation of by-products and significant energy inputs. The use of enzymes for the conversion of organic waste into reusable forms allows important modifications like oxidation, hydrolysis, acylation, and phosphorylation.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Process of organic waste recycling:</b> 
                <br> 
                <b>1. Collection:</b> The first step in the organic waste management of recycling is the collection of waste materials which can either be on a small scale in a kitchen or on a large scale in industries.
                <br> 
                <b>2. Decontamination:</b> An important step in organic waste recycling is the decontamination of waste in order to avoid its harmful effects.
                <br> 
                <b>3. Preparation:</b> Before the organic waste is added to a recycling system, it should be prepared.
                <br> 
                <b>4. Recycling process:</b> Depending on the nature of the organic waste and desired end products, an appropriate method of recycling should be adopted.
                <br> 
                <b>5. Screening and grading:</b> The obtained residues or compost are then screened into different sizes to be used for different purposes.

                <p><b>Plastic recycling</b> encompasses a number of processes through which plastic waste is collected and converted back into useful products, instead of being simply disposed of. When performed correctly, plastic recycling can reduce dependence on landfill, conserve resources and protect the environment from plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Increasing public awareness of plastic pollution has raised demand for plastic recycling, but it remains challenging from a technical and economic standpoint, causing it to lag behind the recycling rates of materials like aluminium, glass and paper. In general, there are many types of plastic and these need to be segregated from one another prior to recycling as they give a poor-quality product if mixed. Even when properly sorted and cleaned, the most common form of recycling in which plastic is re-melted and reformed into new items, usually results in polymer degradation at a chemical level, so that quality cannot be maintained. More advanced technologies which may mitigate this degradation suffer from high capital costs and are more energy hungry. Thus, even though recycling rates are improving, much of this activity merely delays rather than prevents the eventual disposal of plastic as waste. Regardless, life-cycle assessments show recycling in its various forms to be a net good for the environment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since the beginning of plastic production in the 20th century, until 2015, the world has produced some 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, of which 9% has been recycled—only ~1% of total plastic has ever been recycled more than once. The global recycling rate in 2015 was 19.5%, while 25.5% was incinerated and the remaining 55% disposed of to landfill. Only ~2% was recycled in a sustainable closed-loop manner. As of 2019, due to limitations in economic viability, there is little incentive for companies to make a meaningful contribution to the plastic recycling supply chain. The plastics industry has known since the 1970s that recycling of most plastics is unlikely because of these economic limitations. However, the industry has continued to lobby for the expansion of recycling programs while at the same time increasing the amount of virgin plastic being produced.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Almost all plastic is non-biodegradable and thus causes systematic harm to natural ecosystems. For example, approximately 8 million tons of waste plastic enter the Earth's oceans every year, causing damage to the aquatic ecosystem and large ocean garbage patches. Recycling and other forms of utilisation, such as energy recovery, can be part of reducing plastic in the waste stream, but does not alleviate the environmental unsustainability of the plastics industry.</p></div>
